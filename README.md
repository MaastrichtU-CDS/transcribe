Transcribe audio data using Whisper

## Option 1:
[transcribe-insanely-fast-whisper](notebooks/transcribe-insanely-fast-whisper.ipynb) A Jupyter notebook for transcribing audio using Python and a GPU, with the transcriptions saved to a Word document.

## Option 2:
An alternative solution for transcribing audio on your own computer is [Vibe](https://thewh1teagle.github.io/vibe/). Ensure it is properly configured and avoid uploading sensitive data!
